  <h2>The Ultimate Abstraction: Trading ./configure for Click-to-Install</h2>
  <aside>Letting go of the compiler feels strangely liberating, like finally admitting you prefer pre-made microwave meals over hand-grinding your own wheat for bread. Deliciously simple, perhaps?</aside>

<p>MacOS&#8230;</p>
<p>The very name whispers promises of seamless integration and&#8230; well, mostly just working.</p>
<p>Already, there&#8217;s a sense of profound <em>relief</em> when you think about starting with a sleek, aluminium unibody and <em>not</em> having to build everything from the ground up.
And it only gets better â€“ one quick look, and you learn of the magical process of the App Store, where dependencies are someone else&#8217;s elegantly hidden problem. Not only is installing effortless, but updating? It just <em>happens</em>, often while you sleep, like benevolent digital elves maintaining your walled garden. Looking at this, people will naturally wonder, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you switch sooner?&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am, perhaps surprisingly, still the same person who championed LFS, but I now use a MacBook for school, development, and other fun things with newfound <em>ease</em>. What I say doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m telling you how you should use your computer, but an insight into <em>why</em> I personally now crave this&#8230; simplicity. If you are intrigued by this radical shift, and if you want to try macOS; I implore you to experience the polished cage, but be aware of the sheer <em>lack</em> of hardship you&#8217;ll face because, I do want to preface that
macOS is no weekend project in reverse; it&#8217;s an instant gratification machine, and your patience&#8211;or desire to tinker&#8211;will be rendered utterly obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="embracing-pre-packaged-perfection">Embracing Pre-Packaged Perfection</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that macOS is restrictive and locks you down; however, that can only be far from the truth, the <em>real</em> freedom is the liberation from choice. The difficulty isn&#8217;t high either: the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Human Interface Guidelines</a> can be easily ignored as a user, and the process is relatively simple to understand: you click things. Most people can just drag &#38; drop, just like most of troubleshooting involves turning it off and on again anyways. However, there is a level of difficulty in the tedious task of <em>resisting</em> the urge to look under the hood.
But that also isn&#8217;t fully true in itself either, as you can install tools like <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> to automate most installations of things Apple didn&#8217;t deem worthy. Obviously, you could use Windows and also install WSL on top of that, but the ability to have <em>one</em> blessed way of doing things, dictated by Cupertino, without the need to distro-hop, and without the need to worry about isolating package managers because it&#8217;s all handled with magical fairy dust&#8230; it&#8217;s intoxicating.</p>
<p>And that is where we go into one of my favorite aspects of macOS: the ability to accept everything built with Apple&#8217;s tools and environment that <em>they</em> want: <strong>You are blissfully bound to their curated environment</strong>. That probably means everything to the majority of users, and the fact that you are bound to it is very&#8230; relaxing; what
it means is the ability to be consistent&#8211;similar to how LFS is defined by its lack of definition, macOS <em>is</em> defined by its polished, unwavering look and feel&#8211;macOS is defined precisely by what it comes with.</p>
<p>But of course, another thing people say is that macOS is just polished BSD with vendor lock-in. This is not entirely true, macOS is a &#8220;lifestyle&#8221;, a fancy way of saying that although it is much less customizable than even Ubuntu, it is still an &#8220;experience&#8221; at the end of the day.
There are tools and aesthetics forced upon you, such as Finder, the Dock, etc. that make it give you the &#8220;Apple experience&#8221;. A real user experience means starting from <strong>UNBOXING</strong> (no source tarballs or whatever) and accepting the tools they give you, which is what you do on macOS anyways. But then does it mean that you can&#8217;t enjoy the simplicity macOS already gives you? Of course not!</p>
<p>But what I mean is that the lack of customizability and control that you have over your macOS system is unlike any other OS I have ever used. There&#8217;s something satisfying that comes from <em>not</em> understanding how applications are packaged or how system integration really works on a lower level. There is <em>maximum</em> abstraction, and you get to take in the raw &#8220;Consumer Experience&#8221;. There is a sense of relief from avoiding these types of challenges as well, so that&#8217;s another bonus too.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-of-effortlessness">Challenges of Effortlessness</h2>
<p>Of course, the ease of macOS can only be true if you follow the Apple way word for word and don&#8217;t try to shake things up a bit. Everything I said about macOS&#8217;s simplicity before is still true. But the real hell comes from the lack of <em>need</em> for documentation; while the Apple Support pages are comprehensive for common issues, doing anything slightly non-standard often requires accepting it&#8217;s impossible or finding obscure forum threads. Whilst this is the norm for niche problems, at least with the rise of AI: finding answers to macOS internals seems less important than asking how to sync your iCloud photos. Unfortunately for me, doing crazy things like trying to replace launchd with systemd is apparently not in any training data or reality I wish to inhabit anymore. Resulting in just&#8230; not doing it. And trust me, I&#8217;ve done all sorts of web searches, but to no avail. Why fight it?</p>
<p>A common truth that I want to address here is concerning the stability of macOS. And unlike Arch that&#8217;ll break if you look at it funny, or LFS that <em>you</em> break by looking at it funny, macOS is surprisingly stable and nothing usually ever breaks in ways you can fix yourself, only very rarely in ways that require a Genius Bar visit.
And it has to do with the fact that it&#8217;s not very common for most macOS users to update core components themselves, and most macOS users follow the stable releases pushed by Apple that are known to <em>just work</em> (mostly). At least from my experience, a macOS system has never broken in a way that required recompiling the kernel, but there are update issues if you try and hold back: <strong>Apple&#8217;s own damn way</strong>. Other than those outliers, it&#8217;s similar to why appliances are stable in that you rarely ever tinker; and when you update, it usually should work out fine since you usually only update the whole OS monolith, like for example accepting the latest point release rather than worrying about glibc very often.</p>
<p>Challenges to using a macOS system are always&#8230; first-world problems. They always happen due to Apple&#8217;s nature of changing things too much between versions,
but at least for me: the lack of challenge is always worth it. It makes using my computer less exciting, and the results of doing something that <em>everyone</em> does makes me feel&#8230; normal. Every time my computer boots instantly, it&#8217;s a testament to pre-optimization and continuous integration from a massive corporation, and somewhat of a surprise given how complex it must be under the hood (not that I care anymore).</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-seriously">Final Thoughts (Seriously?)</h2>
<p>I have done my best to compile some of my favorite aspects of macOS into a coherent blog post, but in reality it&#8217;s a complicated&#8230; well, actually, it&#8217;s pretty simple. I really think macOS is about embracing abstraction layers and discovering the beauty of a polished surface hiding complex design. Before I tried macOS seriously, I never really understood how simple using a computer could be, how modern tools really made our ideas of computing so effortless and we don&#8217;t really appreciate the work that goes into <em>hiding</em> the complexity; especially for me, as someone who built an OS from scratch, it&#8217;s really thanks to Apple that I have a clear path&#8230; to getting actual work done without compiling GCC for 8 hours.</p>
<p>For all to have made it to the end of this blog post, I want to thank you personally for taking an interest into my shocking change of heart. I want to apologize if this caused any LFS purists heart palpitations. I also want to thank&#8230; uh&#8230; Tim Cook? I guess? For this amazing ecosystem.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all from me! Happy clicking, and may your system updates be error-free!</p>

  <h2>Beyond Prepackaged - Why I Use Linux From Scratch</h2>
  <aside>Building Linux from Scratch can feel a bit like assembling a complex jigsaw puzzle: frustrating at times, but ultimately supremely rewarding when everything clicks into place.</aside>

<p>Linux From Scratch&#8230; </p>
<p>The very name tells you everything that you need to know. </p>
<p>Already, there is a sense of dread when you think about starting with a bare-metal system and building everything from the ground up. 
And it doesn&#8217;t get any better, one quick look, and you learn of the monstrous process of manually installing and resolving your own dependencies. Not only is installing is difficult, but updating it
too. Looking at this, people will naturally wonder, &#8220;why would you even try using LFS?&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am not the average computer user, but I do still use an LFS system for school and other fun things no problem. What I say doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m telling you how you should use your computer, but 
an insight of <em>why</em> I personally enjoy it. If you are interested in what I talk about, and if you want to try LFS; I implore you to try it out or explore it, but be aware of the hardships you&#8217;ll face because, 
I do want to preface that 
LFS is no weekend project, unless it&#8217;s not your first rodeo and you&#8217;re following by the books, it&#8217;s a marathon, and your patience&#8211;or coffee supply&#8211;will be tested.</p>
<h2 id="building-things-from-scratch">Building Things from Scratch</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that LFS is really difficult to maintain, and even sometimes I see people say practically impossible; however that can only be far from the truth, and the difficulty of it isn&#8217;t that 
high as well: the <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/read.html">handbook</a> can be easily skimmed and the process is relatively simple to understand. Most people can just copy &#38; paste, just like most of 
troubleshooting in Arch anyways. However, there is a level of difficulty in the tedious task of installing packages without a package manager. 
But that also isn&#8217;t fully true in itself either, as you can install a package manager like <a href="https://nixos.org/">nix</a> (in my opinion, flatpak done right) to automate most installations. Obviously, you could use normal distros and also install nix on top of that, but the ability
have multiple options like pacman, apt, zypper, xbps, etc. are all available on LFS, without the need to distro-hop, and without the need to isolate the package manager in its own prefix since it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vc7kDjEIhs">really not a good idea to not isolate it</a>.</p>
<p>And that is where we go into one of my favorite aspects of LFS: the ability to build everything with your own tools and environment that you want: <strong>You are not bound to any environment</strong>. That probably means nothing to the majority of users, but the fact that you are not bound to anything is very liberating; what 
it means is the ability to be fluid&#8211;similar to how Arch Linux is not defined to what it looks like, while Ubuntu is generally thought of with their own Gnome spin&#8211;LFS is not defined on what it can 
even come with.</p>
<p>But of course, another thing people say is that <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/get-started/about/">Gentoo</a> is just LFS with tools on top. This is not entirely true, Gentoo is a &#8220;meta-distro&#8221;, a fancy way of saying that although it is much more customizable than Arch, it is still a &#8220;distro&#8221; at the end of the day. 
There are tools that are forced upon you, such as portage, udev, etc. that make it give you the &#8220;gentoo experience&#8221;. A real LFS with tools would be starting from <strong>SCRATCH</strong> (no stage3s or whatever) and adding the tools 
you want yourself, which is what you do on LFS anyways. But then does it mean that you can&#8217;t enjoy the customizability Gentoo already gives you? Of course not!</p>
<p>But what I mean is that the customizability and control that you have over your LFS system is unlike any other distro I have ever used. There&#8217;s something satisfying that comes from understanding how all packages are 
compiled and how USE flags on Gentoo really works on a lower level. There is much less abstraction, and you get to take in the raw &#8220;Linux experience&#8221;. There is a sense of accomplishment from doing these types of 
challenges as well, so that&#8217;s another bonus too.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Of course, the ease of LFS can only be true if you follow the handbook word by word and not shake things up a bit. Everything I said about LFS&#8217; difficulty before is still true. But the real hell comes from lack of 
documentation; while the handbook is comprehensive, doing anything not in the handbook often require digging through forum threads and&#47;or mailing lists. Whilst this is the norm for most programmers, at least with the 
rise of AI: finding answers to those programming questions are much easier and generally accurate. Unfortunately for me, doing crazy things like a pure clang toolchain on LFS is apparently not in any training data of any popular LLMs 
I&#8217;ve tried, resulting in just trial and error. And trust me, I&#8217;ve done all sorts of prompt engineering, but to no avail.</p>
<p>A common misconception that I want to address here is concerning the stability of LFS. And unlike Arch that&#8217;ll break if you breath on it the wrong way, LFS is surprisingly stable and nothing usually ever breaks, only very rarely. 
And it has to do with the fact that it&#8217;s not very common for most LFS users to update their packages and most LFS users following stable releases of the handbook that are known to work. At least from my experience, a LFS system has never broke on me 
but there are compilation issues if you try and do what I do: <strong>my own damn way</strong>. Other than those outliers, it&#8217;s similar to why debian is stable in that you rarely ever update; and when you do, it usually should work out fine 
since you usually only update one minor component of the system, like for example firefox rather than core components like glibc very often.</p>
<p>Challenges to using a LFS system are always annoying, they always happen due to my nature of tinkering too much, 
but at least for me: the challenge is always worth it. It makes using my computer more exciting, and the results of doing something that no one really does makes me feel great. Every time my computer boots, it&#8217;s a 
testament to perseverance and continuous learning, and somewhat of a surprise to the stability of a LFS system.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I have done my best to compile some of my favorite aspects of LFS into a coherent blog post, but in reality it&#8217;s a complicated love-hate relationship. I really think LFS is about breaking 
abstraction layers and discovering the beauty of simplicity beneath complex design. Before I have tried LFS, I never really understood how complex Linux was, how modern tools really made 
our ideas of distros so convoluted and we don&#8217;t really appreciate the effort and work that really goes into it; especially for me, as the founder of LearnixOS, it&#8217;s really thanks to LFS 
that I have a clear path and a vision to create an independent distro. </p>
<p>For all to have made it to the end of this blog post, I want to thank you personally for taking an interest into what I have to say. I want to apologize for the wait, I&#8217;ve been pretty caught up 
with school, and hopefully I can try to make these come out faster. I also want to thank Patrick from the LearnixTV server for this amazing idea, I hope I answered the question to a satisfactory 
amount.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all from me! Happy building, and may your compilations be error-free!</p>

  <h2>No Blue Screens Here, Just a Bit of Kernel Panic and a Whole Load of Blogging</h2>
  <aside>An introduction, why would I create a blog, plans for the future, and other random things</aside>
  <address>cowmonk</address>
  <time datetime="2025-03-18">2025-03-18</time>
 </header>
<p>It was a simple suggestion from someone on the LearnixTV server when I completed one of the hardest challenges of my linux journey, achieving 30mib idle with dwm running on a modern 64 bit system: <strong>&#8220;why don&#8217;t you make a blog post about this?&#8221;</strong>, or something along those lines. It really stuck with me, and it was further strengthened by <a href="https://kirawano.github.io/YARB.html">kirwano&#8217;s blogs</a> and <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/tronnerd82">TronNerd&#8217;s blogs</a>; reading them gave me a lot of inspiration in what I could write about and get down into.
The idea of writing and documenting what I did and writing guides for other enthusiasts like myself intrigued me. But when I do write, hopefully I won&#8217;t bore anyone with what I have to say and people can gain insight from these blogs.</p>
<h2 id="more-about-me">More about me</h2>
<p>For the unaware, I am known as cowmonk, a crazy linux lunatic if the intro didn&#8217;t tell you otherwise. My first daily driver was arch, being the only reason for using it (being a life long windows user back then) was for a challenge. Hence, it was a no-brainer for me to move to gentoo as I naturally sought more ways to inconvenience myself whilst using my computer. My time on gentoo was simply put: &#8220;a tinker&#8217;s dream&#8221;, I gradually became a huge suckless shill and loved the minimalist approach.
This brought me down a massive rabbit hole and I began to aim for the most bloatless system, with the least possible amount of ram used.
And so, began the long journey to 30mib and &#8220;debloating&#8221; my system. It was then however, after acheiving such a massive goal, I realized that there was
truly nothing left for me to do, and finally my switch to LFS as my final distro and daily driver.</p>
<p>During this time of my linux journey, I also somehow became the founder of <a href="https://learnixos.github.io">LearnixOS</a>, which started out as a joke. In fact, the distro was supposed to be a spin off of Linux Mint, and just be another Hannah Montana joke distro. It went through many ideas and iterations of what it could be. How I would love to continue on about the history of LearnixOS, but that&#8217;ll be for a future blog post. Long story short, LearnixOS is now LFS based, and as of writing there are already multiple people working on it and its own <a href="https://learnixos.github.io/lxpkg.html">custom package manager</a>. </p>
<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>I plan to continue these blogs as frequent as possible, a partial reason being to help me get better at writing in english. If your cup of tea is to listen to a nerd do nerdy things, I hope that by the end of every blog post from me you are able to replicate my actions or learn something. There might be a few rants&#47;papers coming up, but also on the process on some insane projects I did in the past; There are also plans for guides, such as tips and tricks for custom kernels if anyone is
interested in that.
These plans aren&#8217;t fully set in stone and it would be interesting to dive into other things, such as updates on LearnixOS or anything of the like.</p>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>If you want to contact me, my public contact exists on discord primarily: cowmonk (duh)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really use anything else, unless I really want to doxx myself.</p>
