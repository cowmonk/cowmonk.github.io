                <h2><span class="prompt">$</span> Who am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello there! I'm cowmonk. I'm passionate about open-source software, the Linux ecosystem, and building things from the ground up. This space is where I document my journey, share what I learn, and showcase my work.</p>
                <p>My philosophy is rooted in the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, much like the tools I admire (DWM, suckless utilities, etc.). I believe in understanding the core of how things work, hence my adventures with Linux From Scratch.</p>
                <p>When I'm not staring at a terminal, you might find me online or doing some other hobbist nerdy things such as getting into the nitty gritty of audiophile things.</p>

                    <h3>[ LearnixOS ]</h3>
                    <p>I was the founder of the github and project, most of the projects are under my old github profile. It's a Linux-based operating system designed for both beginners exploring Linux for the first time and advanced users seeking a lightweight yet powerful OS for daily use.</p>
