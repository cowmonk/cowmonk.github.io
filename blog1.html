<p>It was a simple suggestion from someone on the LearnixTV server when I completed one of the hardest challenges of my linux journey, achieving 30mib idle with dwm running on a modern 64 bit system: <strong>&#8220;why don&#8217;t you make a blog post about this?&#8221;</strong>, or something along those lines. It really stuck with me, and it was further strengthened by <a href="https://kirawano.github.io/YARB.html">kirwano&#8217;s blogs</a> and <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/tronnerd82">TronNerd&#8217;s blogs</a>; reading them gave me a lot of inspiration in what I could write about and get down into.
The idea of writing and documenting what I did and writing guides for other enthusiasts like myself intrigued me. But when I do write, hopefully I won&#8217;t bore anyone with what I have to say and people can gain insight from these blogs.</p>
<h1 id="more-about-me">More about me</h1>
<p>For the unaware, I am known as cowmonk, a crazy linux lunatic if the intro didn&#8217;t tell you otherwise. My first daily driver was arch, being the only reason for using it (being a life long windows user back then) was for a challenge. Hence, it was a no-brainer for me to move to gentoo as I naturally sought more ways to inconvenience myself whilst using my computer. My time on gentoo was simply put: &#8220;a tinker&#8217;s dream&#8221;, I gradually became a huge suckless shill and loved the minimalist approach.
This brought me down a massive rabbit hole and I began to aim for the most bloatless system, with the least possible amount of ram used.
And so, began the long journey to 30mib and &#8220;debloating&#8221; my system. It was then however, after acheiving such a massive goal, I realized that there was
truly nothing left for me to do, and finally my switch to LFS as my final distro and daily driver.</p>
<p>During this time of my linux journey, I also somehow became the founder of <a href="https://learnixos.github.io">LearnixOS</a>, which started out as a joke. In fact, the distro was supposed to be a spin off of Linux Mint, and just be another Hannah Montana joke distro. It went through many ideas and iterations of what it could be. How I would love to continue on about the history of LearnixOS, but that&#8217;ll be for a future blog post. Long story short, LearnixOS is now LFS based, and as of writing there are already multiple people working on it and its own <a href="https://learnixos.github.io/lxpkg.html">custom package manager</a>. </p>
<h1 id="plans">Plans</h1>
<p>I plan to continue these blogs as frequent as possible, a partial reason being to help me get better at writing in english. If your cup of tea is to listen to a nerd do nerdy things, I hope that by the end of every blog post from me you are able to replicate my actions or learn something. There might be a few rants&#47;papers coming up, but also on the process on some insane projects I did in the past; There are also plans for guides, such as tips and tricks for custom kernels if anyone is
interested in that.
These plans aren&#8217;t fully set in stone and it would be interesting to dive into other things, such as updates on LearnixOS or anything of the like.</p>
<h1 id="contact">Contact</h1>
<p>If you want to contact me, my public contact exists on discord primarily: cowmonk (duh)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really use anything else, unless I really want to doxx myself.</p>
